## Getting Started (Development)

To get a local copy of the full application up and running, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

* **Node.js and npm:** Make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system. You can download them from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
* A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, etc.).
* A local web server for serving the frontend files (e.g., VS Code's "Live Server" extension, or Python's `http.server`).

### Backend Setup (Crucial for Multiplayer)

1.  **Navigate to the backend directory:**
    ```bash
    cd tic-tac-toe-showdown/tic-tac-toe-backend
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install express cors
    ```
3.  **Run the backend server:**
    ```bash
    node server.js
    ```
    You should see `Server on http://localhost:3000` in your console. Keep this terminal window open and the server running while you use the application.

### Frontend Setup

1.  **Navigate to the frontend directory:**
    ```bash
    cd tic-tac-toe-showdown/tic-tac-toe-front
    ```
2.  **Ensure audio files are in the `assets/` directory:** Verify that `click-button.mp3`, `drawing-sound.mp3`, `music-play1.mp3`, and `win-sound.mp3` are all present in `tic-tac-toe-front/assets/`.
3.  **Verify CSS and JS linking:** Double-check that all your HTML files (`index.html`, `game.html`, `robot-game.html`) correctly link to their respective CSS files in `css/` and JavaScript files in `js/`.

### Running the Application

1.  **Start the Frontend:** Open `index.html` in your web browser.
    * **Recommended:** Use a local web server (like VS Code's "Live Server") to serve the `tic-tac-toe-front` directory. Right-click `index.html` and select "Open with Live Server". This ensures correct handling of `fetch` requests and other browser features.
    * Alternatively, you can open `index.html` directly in your browser, but be aware that `game.html`'s multiplayer functionality might behave unexpectedly without a proper server due to cross-origin restrictions on `fetch` requests.

2.  **Test Multiplayer (`game.html`):**
    * With the backend server running, open two separate browser tabs or windows and navigate to `http://localhost:<YOUR_FRONTEND_PORT>/game.html` (e.g., `http://localhost:5500/game.html` if using Live Server).
    * In the first tab, enter a name and click "Start Game" (or just wait for "Your Code" to appear). Share this code.
    * In the second tab, enter a different name, paste the code from the first tab into "Opponent's Code", and click "Start Game". The game should connect!

3.  **Test AI (`robot-game.html`):**
    * Navigate to `http://localhost:<YOUR_FRONTEND_PORT>/robot-game.html` in a single tab.
    * Enter your name and click "Start Game" to begin playing against the AI.

* **Customizable Player Marks:** Allow players to choose different symbols or colors.
* **Advanced Animations:** Add more dynamic and visually appealing animations for wins, draws, and general gameplay.
* **Sound/Music Volume Control:** Allow users to adjust individual volume levels for sounds and music.
